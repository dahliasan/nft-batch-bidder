This is a project I'm working on for the [buildspace Nights and Weekends 6-week program](https://twitter.com/_buildspace/status/1526672744053542912).

# Overview of this project

The goal of this project is to allow users to,

- search and display a collection
- filter the collection's nfts by trait
- add nfts to "cart"
- place a bid on all items in the cart with a button after connecting wallet (the bids are added to the opensea orderbook)
